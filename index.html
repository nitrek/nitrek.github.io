<aside class="notes">
	Working of all these different projects in different areas and technologies a evolved my thinking helped with think
	outside the box finding unique and unconventional solutions to problems and challenges I face.It’s like what Frans Johansson, Medici Effect 
	Said, Best innovation Occur at intersection.
	Some examples would be I developed a tool that will generate your resume from the commits you do on alm-github ,URL
	shortner .

					<h2>Inquisitive</h2>
					<p>
					To grow one needs to keep learning always ,that is my motto in life
<blockquote cite="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/einstein/wisd-nf.html">
&ldquo;The important thing is not to stop questioning; curiosity has its own reason for existing.&rdquo;– Albert
Einstein
</blockquote>

<aside class="notes">
	I can’t keep being unconventional If I don’t upgrade myself that leads to my next point , I am always inquisitive , I
	like always have a thing I am learning currently actively and I am always curious to find anything I don’t understand
	and I keep doing courses/certifications to enhance my technical skills.
	You might be wondering how can I manage to do all this , it is because I am passionate about the work I am doing
 Coursera,Udemy,Quora,Mashable,Youtube,always have a thing i am currently learning,Certification,Paper,Teach
